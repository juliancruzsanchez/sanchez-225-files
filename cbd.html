      <h1>CBD Benefits</h1>
      <h2>What is CBD?</h2>
      <p>CBD is a compound found in the cannabis plant. Unlike the THC found in much of cannabis products sold in dispensaries accross the U.S., CBD is not psychoactive. This means that it does not produce the "high" effects associated with THC usage. With the ability to reduce inflammation, anxiety, and pain, all without producing a high, it has been trending as a popular, nationally legal, and safe supplement for many people.</p>
      <h2>What are the benefits of CBD?</h2>
      <p>The benefits of CBD are many. It can help with anxiety, pain, inflammation, and more. Personally, I find that it helps me manage my pain and muscle spasms all day with a discreet 3 times per day dosing. It's as simple as taking a multivitamin, just chew a gummy or take a liquid dropper under your tongue.</p>
      <h2>How does CBD work?</h2>
      <p>CBD works by interacting with the endocannabinoid system. The endocannabinoid system is a system in the body that regulates things like pain, inflammation, and anxiety. </p>
      <h2>How much CBD should I take?</h2>
      <p>The amount of CBD you should take depends on the individual. It is important to talk to your doctor before taking CBD. I recommend starting with a low dose and increasing as needed. One thing to note is that you can often increase the effectiveness of CBD by taking it with <a href="cbg.html">CBG, another non-psychoactive compound found in the plant.</a></p>
